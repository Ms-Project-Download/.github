## What is Borderless Gaming?

**Borderless Gaming** is a powerful and user-friendly application designed to transform your traditional fullscreen or windowed games into a seamless **borderless windowed mode**. This innovative software eliminates the common frustrations associated with fullscreen gaming, such as alt-tab delays, screen flickering, and application crashes when switching between tasks. By running your games in a borderless window, you can enjoy a truly immersive gaming experience while maintaining the ability to multitask efficiently. Whether you are a streamer managing your broadcast software, a content creator capturing gameplay footage, or a casual gamer who frequently checks guides and chats, Borderless Gaming ensures that your gameplay remains smooth and uninterrupted.

The software is compatible with a vast library of PC games, including popular titles like **Minecraft**, **Metro Exodus**, **Cyberpunk 2077**, and many others. It works by intercepting the game's window management and applying a borderless fullscreen effect, which makes the game appear as if it's running in exclusive fullscreen mode while actually being in a window. This technique provides the best of both worlds: the performance of fullscreen and the convenience of windowed mode. Additionally, Borderless Gaming is an open-source project, which means it is continuously improved by a community of developers and is completely free to use. Its lightweight nature ensures that it does not consume significant system resources, allowing your games to run at their maximum potential.
